# about
li0nminer is an interface (batch file) that sits on top of Claymore's miner. It quickly allows you to create and modify a configuration file for the miner. This batch file will only mine ETH at this time but I plan to add the other options that Claymore has alredy configured. My goal is this little batch file might make it a little less scary for something trying to start up mining.
